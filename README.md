# Introducing Money:
A Raspberry-Pi powered basic voice assistant which accepts vocal inputs and delivers verbal feedback. 
However, this voice assistant is meant to be more than just a chat-buddy. It is meant to greatly improve the productivity of some of the laziest, most non-productive people in the world (such as myself). Instead of spending precious time and energy moving my fingers across a keyboard, I aim to simply execute tasks through giving vocal instructions to Money - be it from simply bouncing ideas back and forth, to drafting and sending complete emails, executing SSH comands across multiple devices, and managing my homelab - all by voice.

## Some Technical Overview:
